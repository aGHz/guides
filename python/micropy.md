&#181;.py
====

&#181;.py (Micro.py, micropy, upy) is an alternative approach to building web applications in Python
based on nascent philosophies in the Javascript world (c.f. [microjs](http://microjs.com/) and [Ender](http://ender.no.de/)),
as well as the guiding principle behind Linux development (_Small applications that do one thing and do it well_).
The driving idea is to eschew full-stack frameworks in favour of a collection of
extremely specialized and efficient modules.

Components
==========
All components are merely recommended.

Outside the app
---------------
* [Nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/Main)
* [uWSGI](http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/wiki/Doc)
* [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/)
* [Fabric](http://docs.fabfile.org/)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/book), [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) and [GitHub](http://github.com)
* codebase directory structure inspired by the [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard)
  for self-contained, easily-deployable app environments

Inside the app
--------------
* a WSGI middleware stack manager (for an easily configurable stack with automatic dependency ordering)
* a dispatcher to map URLs to Python code: [Colubrid](http://wsgiarea.pocoo.org/colubrid/documentation/)
* database access: [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/), [MongoEngine](http://mongoengine.org/), [PyMongo](http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/)
* template rendering: [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/), [Mako](http://docs.makotemplates.org/en/latest/index.html)

* cache and session management: [Beaker](http://beaker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)
* HTML form validation
* authentication and authorization
* automatic admins

A good list of possibly acceptable modules can by found on the [Python wiki](http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebComponents).


Component acceptability guidelines
==================================

For a module to be deemed micro
* it **must** have a very clearly defined scope of functionality
* it **should** have proper documentation
* it **should** have a relatively small and very clean codebase, so as to be easily understandable


Zen of &#181;
========
* Modular is better than monolythic
* Clean, intuitive source code is better than documentation
* But documentation is still essential
* Two modules chasing one rabbit each do better than one module chasing two rabbits
