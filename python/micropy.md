&#181;.py
====

&#181;.py (Micro.py) is an alternative approach to building web applications in Python
based on nascent philosophies in the Javascript world
(c.f. [microjs](http://microjs.com/) and [Ender](http://ender.no.de/)), as well as the
guiding principle behind Linux development (_Small applications that do only one thing, and they do it well_).
The driving idea is to provide a complete support framework by piecing together small,
extremely specialized and efficient modules, while keeping all such modules optional and replaceable.
