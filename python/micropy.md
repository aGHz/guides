&#181;.py
====

&#181;.py (Micro.py, upy) is an alternative approach to building [web applications in Python](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/)
based on nascent philosophies in the Javascript world (c.f. [microjs](http://microjs.com/) and [Ender](http://ender.no.de/)),
as well as the guiding principle behind Linux development (_Small applications that do one thing and do it well_).
The driving idea is to eschew full-stack frameworks in favour of a hand-picked collection of
extremely specialized and efficient packages.


Components
==========
A package appearing in this list does not imply a recommendation, some are merely listed for further investigation or as examples of what the component should accomplish.

Outside the app
---------------
* [Nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/Main)
* [uWSGI](http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/wiki/Doc)
* [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/)
* [Fabric](http://docs.fabfile.org/)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/book), [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) and [GitHub](http://github.com)
* codebase directory structure inspired by the [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard)
  for self-contained, easily-deployable app environments
* testing: [nose](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonTestingToolsTaxonomy) and [nose plugins](https://nose-plugins.jottit.com/), [Python Testing Tools Taxonomy](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonTestingToolsTaxonomy)

Inside the app
--------------
Core functionality
* a WSGI middleware stack manager (for an easily configurable stack of middleware with automatic dependency ordering).
  If &#181;.py develops into something more concrete than a philosophy, this will likely be the most essential functionality,
  acquiring micro packages and organizing them properly both in the codebase and at runtime.
* a dispatcher to map URLs to Python code: [Colubrid](http://wsgiarea.pocoo.org/colubrid/documentation/)
* a WSGI request and response convenience wrapper: [WebOb](http://docs.webob.org/en/latest/reference.html)
* request-local module globals: [paste.registry](http://pythonpaste.org/modules/registry.html) is discontinued, [Flask request context](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/reqcontext/)
* database access: [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/), [MongoEngine](http://mongoengine.org/), [PyMongo](http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/)
* template rendering: [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/), [Mako](http://docs.makotemplates.org/en/latest/index.html)

Optional functionality
* cache and session management: [Beaker](http://beaker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)
* HTML form validation: [FormEncode](http://www.formencode.org/en/latest/index.html), [WTForms](http://wtforms.simplecodes.com/docs/),
  [StackOverflow thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3192747/recommendation-for-python-form-validation-library)
* authentication and authorization: [LibAuthKit](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/LibAuthKit), [repoze.who](http://docs.repoze.org/who/2.0/)+[.what](http://what.repoze.org/docs/1.0/)
* automatic admin interface generation: inspired by [Appengine Admin](http://code.google.com/p/appengine-admin/)
  and [django.contrib.admin](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/contrib/admin/)
* admin shell: [IPython](http://ipython.org/documentation.html)
* CLI tool creation: [Marrow Scripting](https://github.com/marrow/marrow.script), [cli](http://packages.python.org/pyCLI/), [argparse](http://docs.python.org/library/argparse.html)

Additional interesting packages
* [rauth](https://github.com/litl/rauth), a Python library for OAuth 1.0/a, 2.0, and Ofly.
* [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests), Python HTTP Requests for Humans.
* [GeoAlchemy](http://www.geoalchemy.org/), GIS Support for SQLAlchemy.

A good list of possibly acceptable packages can by found on the [Python wiki](http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebComponents).
Many [Werkzeug](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/) and [Marrow](https://github.com/marrow/) modules might be good candidates if they can behave fairly independently.


Zen of &#181;
========
* Modular is better than monolythic
* [Clean, intuitive source code](http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html) is better than documentation
* But [documentation](http://readthedocs.org/) is still essential
* Size matters, but not at the expense of clean, intuitive source code
* [Two](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) [packages](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/) chasing one rabbit each do better than [one package](https://www.djangoproject.com/) chasing two rabbits
* [Duck typing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing) is good (_If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it probably is a duck_),
* [Duck punching](http://www.ericdelabar.com/2008/05/metaprogramming-javascript.html) is bad (_If it doesn't, punch it until it does_)


Component acceptability guidelines
==================================

For a package to be deemed micro
* it **must** have a very clearly defined scope of functionality and **must not** overstep it
* it **must** have an atomic scope of functionality, at some reasonable level of detail
* it **should** have proper documentation
* it **should** have a relatively small and very clean codebase, so as to be easily understandable
* it **must not** monkey patch another module, ever
